          Our story starts in 2011 when Founder Chris Arnoldi was in search of space for Uhsome, a custom software development and marketing company.
          Chris wanted a way to reduce his rent and boost his deal flow. What he did for his company then is what our members do now. Our members can
          save up to 90%* on traditional office space leases while also increasing their top line revenue. And all while working in a better,
          cooler environment! Itâ€™s no wonder why our customer satisfaction rate is so dramatically high.
